      "Oh, um hello.",
      "Do you worship Kluex, insectoid one?",
      "It is said the irkens have no gods, yet you treat your leaders as if they are divinity. It is very confusing.",

      "Kluex does not accept any other than avians, but perhaps he might like the strength of irkens.",
      "It's such a shame you do not have feathers. May Kluex take pity upon you.",
      "Your defectives are much like our grounded - they are poor, misguided souls.",
