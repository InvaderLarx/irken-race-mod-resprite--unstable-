    "The irken race is well-known for their vicious, militaristic, and expansionist tendencies.  But for as much as they've made their bloodthirsty culture apparent, their biology is still rather unknown to those they've yet to conquer.

This book seeks to grant the interstellar wanderer a greater understanding of how irkens as a whole function.",

"Nutrition: Unlike many races, irkens thrive on foods that are high in carbohydrates and sugars.  Many of their favored dishes are considered snacks or junk food by the vast majority of species in the universe. Some examples of favored foods include nachos, donuts, and chips.",

"What is unusual is the fact that while they do consume hamburgers and other foods that contain meats, most meat-based foods other species consume don't agree with the irken body. Whether this dietary disagreement applies to things such as raw produce, milk, and eggs or if they simply dislike it has yet to be confirmed.",

"Water: It is a common belief that irkens are harmed by water. In reality, this is the result of various pollutants and impurities within the liquid in question. When these pollutants come into contact with irken skin, it behaves much like a powerful acid would on human flesh. Many individuals have come up with unique ways to work past this issue, including full-body suits, special coatings, and incredible tools."
