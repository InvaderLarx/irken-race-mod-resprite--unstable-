    "There has been a massive uptick in deviant behavior among irkens.  Errors present in their PAK are responsible for these defectives' existence.

Should you find yourself face-to-face with a known defective, proceed with caution.  Their irrational and unpredictable behavior makes them difficult to deal with.  Have a soldier or elite detain them, if possible, so that they may have an existence evaluation scheduled."
