    "Every species has its own heirarchy, its own way of determining who is on top.  The irken are no exception to this rule.  However, their method of leadership would be considered odd to most.  Why, you might ask?

Because it's height that matters most.",

"Height determines ones social standing in irken society, with the shortest often given the most demeaning and undesireable jobs possible for their class. On the other hand, the taller an individaul is, the more respect they tend to command. Frequently, taller irken are put into cushier positions or are otherwise treated far better than their shorter kin. Skills and accomplishments play a role, but nowhere near as mucha s height.",

"One might then ask what happens when an irken ends up the tallest member of the species. The answer is simple - they become the leader of the entire empire. This individual is simply called the Tallest, and all other irkens hold them in high regard. Should two irken tie for the position, both are to rule at the same time.",

"The current ruling Tallest as of this writing is not one, but two individuals.  Almighty Tallest Red and Tallest Purple currently reign over all of the Irken Empire as a pair - both are identical, save for the color that matches their name. The ascended to the position after the single-day reign of Tallest Spork. The duo are well-liked, and sho zero signs of their reign ending anytime soon."
