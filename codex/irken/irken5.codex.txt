    "Organs: The average irken possesses some of the same organs that the vast majority of known species do, such as the brain and heart. But many other organs that so many other species have aren't present in irkens, instead condensed into a single super-organ that performs the same jobs - something known as the squeedilyspooch. This biological structure takes up much of the abdominal cavity, and is likely the largest of all internal organs.",

"Other Features: There are also a few other notable features present in irken biology. One of these is their sensitive antennae, which they can freely move at will. The appendages are frequently used for expression. It's believed they may also serve as a form of sensory organ much like in Earth's insects, but there hasn't been enough research gathered to confirm this.",

"They also possess large, monochromatic eyes that come in a variety of colors. Most common is a ruby red, but several different hues have been observed. These eyes may seem simple, but they provide the irken species with keen sight.

Finally, their height compared to other species is noteworthy - the average mature irken is shorter than the average adult human. This feature hardly keeps them from being a threat, but has had enough of an impact to be firmly cemented in their culture."
